PMC to Count-Min is as HyperLogLog to Bloomfilter

Package pmc provides a Probabilistic Multiplicity Counting Sketch, a novel data structure that is capable of accounting traffic per flow probabilistically, that can be used as an alternative to Count-min sketch.
The stream processing algorithm — Probabilistic Multiplicity Counting (PMC) — uses probabilistic counting techniques to determine the approximate multiplicity of each element in large streams. It is particularly well suited for traffic measurements on high-speed communication links and likewise applicable for many other purposes.

Count-Min Sketches hold counters in a matrix-like organization. A big caveat for both Spectral Bloom Filters and Count-Min Sketches is that the maximum multiplicity has to be known a priori quite accurately, to provide large enough counters without wasting too much memory. PMC does not need to know the maximum frequency beforehand, and its counting operation is much simpler.
